RandomSQS
=========

This class is used to generate the Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS) to model the 1/2<111>
 screw dislocation in a binary bcc lattice.
It redefines a bcc lattice with c axis along <111> and inserts the dislocation dipole.
Then it generates the SQS for a given concentration.
 
To get a RandomSQS one initializes the RandomSQS object
