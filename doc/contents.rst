AMDM Structure Generation Tools (SGT)
================================

This tool set compiles a set of special structure generation modules and analysis tools. 
The tools are designed as python functions or classes. The goal is to provide a comprehensive API
for some common tasks that are easy to use but also extremely versatile as they integrate with
the powerful tool set of `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html>`_. It is advised to get familiar with the basics of `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html>`_ 
before using this package.
